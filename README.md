## STM32 FCU in Rust

### Introduction

This project is an experiment of mine. I had a STEVAL-FCU001V1 drone kit that I had been playing with in C++ and thought it would be interesting to write some Rust firmware from it.

As for whether it will fly, who knows? More likely, it will turn into a yet another balancing bot, or maybe just a learning project.
